# Planet-RL → Planetary Science Toolkit
## A Research Scientist's Wishlist

*Written from the perspective of a planetary scientist who needs this as a primary research tool, not a training environment. The current codebase is an excellent foundation. What follows is an honest gap analysis and a prioritised roadmap for turning it into something publishable-quality.*

---

## What We Have vs. What Science Needs

The current tool does three things well: it generates physically plausible planets, integrates spacecraft trajectories around them, and visualises the results cleanly. That's genuinely useful. But a working scientist needs to ask questions like:

- *Is this planet inside the habitable zone of its star?*
- *What is the minimum ΔV budget for a spacecraft to reach orbit, circularise, and survive aerocapture?*
- *How does the J2 precession rate at 300 km compare between Mars and a hypothetical Super-Earth with the same surface gravity?*
- *What is the ground track of a polar orbit after 10 days? Where are the observation gaps?*
- *Given a 5,000 kg spacecraft and a 10-year transfer from Earth, what is the maximum payload that arrives with enough fuel to insert?*

None of these are answerable yet. Below is a detailed breakdown of every missing capability, grouped by scientific domain, with concrete implementation notes.

## Priority 1 — The Planetary Interior Model

**What's missing and why it matters most.**

Right now `mass` and `radius` are independent inputs. In reality, a planet's internal structure is the *source* of almost every observable property: bulk density tells you the iron fraction, which tells you the magnetic dynamo strength, which tells you the atmosphere retention history, which tells you the surface conditions today. Everything is coupled.

### 1a. Interior Structure Model (`core/interior.py`)

A layered interior with differentiation:

```python
@dataclass
class InteriorLayer:
    name: str                    # "iron core", "silicate mantle", "ice shell"
    outer_radius_frac: float     # fraction of planet radius
    density: float               # kg/m³
    material: str                # "Fe", "FeS", "silicate", "water_ice", "H2"
    heat_production: float       # W/kg  (radiogenic heating)

@dataclass
class InteriorConfig:
    enabled: bool = False
    layers: list[InteriorLayer] = field(default_factory=list)

    @property
    def core_radius_fraction(self) -> float: ...
    @property
    def iron_mass_fraction(self) -> float: ...
    @property
    def moment_of_inertia_factor(self) -> float:
        """I / (MR²) — 0.4 = uniform, 0.33 = Earth, 0.22 = differentiated"""
    @property
    def radiogenic_heat_flux(self) -> float:
        """W/m² — drives volcanism, tectonics, magnetic dynamo"""
```

**Why this matters:**
- Moment of inertia factor (MoI) is directly observable via precession rate and is used to infer internal structure from orbital data. Right now J2 is a free parameter — it should *derive* from the MoI.
- A large iron core → strong magnetic dynamo → retained atmosphere → surface liquid water → potential habitability. This causal chain is scientifically essential.
- Radiogenic heat flux determines whether a planet is still geologically active (plate tectonics, volcanism, outgassing), which feeds the atmosphere composition model.

### 1b. Derived Properties from Interior

Once the interior model exists, these become computable instead of inputs:

```python
# Currently: planet.magnetic_field.strength = MagneticFieldStrength.MEDIUM (hand-set)
# Should be: derived from core size + rotation rate + radiogenic heating
planet.interior.dynamo_number        # dimensionless — predicts magnetic field generation
planet.interior.predicted_B_surface  # Tesla — surface field strength
planet.magnetic_field.strength       # auto-set from interior

# Currently: planet.oblateness.J2 = 1.08e-3 (hand-set)
# Should be: J2 = f(rotation_period, MoI_factor, equatorial_radius)
planet.interior.predicted_J2         # derived from rotation + MoI
```

---

## Priority 2 — Atmospheric Science

The current atmosphere is a single exponential scale height. This is adequate for drag modelling but useless for actual atmospheric science.

### 2a. Multi-Layer Atmosphere (`core/atmosphere_science.py`)

Real atmospheres have structure. Earth has troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere. Each has different physics.

```python
@dataclass
class AtmosphericLayer:
    name: str                    # "troposphere", "stratosphere", etc.
    base_altitude: float         # m
    top_altitude: float          # m
    base_temperature: float      # K
    lapse_rate: float            # K/m (positive = cooling with altitude)
    composition: dict[str, float]  # {"N2": 0.78, "O2": 0.21, ...} mole fractions
    mean_molar_mass: float       # g/mol — determines scale height
    
@dataclass
class MultiLayerAtmosphere:
    layers: list[AtmosphericLayer]
    
    def density_at_altitude(self, h: float) -> float:
        """Full hydrostatic integration through all layers."""
    
    def temperature_at_altitude(self, h: float) -> float:
        """Correct piecewise temperature profile."""
    
    def mean_molar_mass_at_altitude(self, h: float) -> float:
        """Changes with photodissociation in upper atmosphere."""
    
    def speed_of_sound(self, h: float) -> float:
        """c = √(γRT/M) — needed for sonic aerobraking transitions."""
    
    def dynamic_viscosity(self, h: float) -> float:
        """Sutherland's law — needed for boundary layer drag at low Re."""
```

### 2b. Atmospheric Composition Tracking

The current `AtmosphereComposition` enum is a label, not physics. The composition should be a dictionary that feeds into everything:

```python
# Current: composition = AtmosphereComposition.CO2_THICK  (just a label)
# Proposed: actual mole fractions that drive derived quantities

composition = {
    "CO2": 0.965,
    "N2":  0.035,
    "SO2": 0.00015,
}

# These then determine:
mean_molar_mass = sum(frac * MOLAR_MASS[gas] for gas, frac in composition.items())
# → scale height H = RT/(Mg)  — now physically derived, not hand-set
# → greenhouse forcing GHF = f(CO2_ppm, CH4_ppm, H2O_ppm)  — for surface temp
# → atmospheric escape rate = f(EUV_flux, M_gas, T_exosphere)
```

### 2c. Atmospheric Loss and Evolution

The most interesting question in planetary science: *why did Mars lose its atmosphere?*

```python
class AtmosphericEscape:
    """Jeans escape, ion pickup, sputtering, hydrodynamic escape."""
    
    def jeans_escape_rate(self, planet, gas: str, T_exosphere: float) -> float:
        """
        Thermal escape rate for a given gas species.
        Rate ∝ exp(-v_esc² / v_thermal²)
        Hydrogen escapes from Mars; CO2 does not from Venus.
        """
    
    def ion_pickup_rate(self, planet, solar_wind_pressure: float) -> float:
        """
        Solar wind stripping rate — dominant on Mars (no magnetosphere).
        vs. negligible on Earth (strong magnetosphere deflects solar wind).
        """
    
    def characteristic_escape_time(self, planet, gas: str) -> float:
        """How many years until this gas species is half-depleted?"""
```

This directly connects the magnetic field model to the atmosphere model in a physically motivated way.

### 2d. Greenhouse Effect and Surface Temperature

Currently `surface_temp` is an input. It should be computable:

```python
def compute_surface_temperature(
    planet,
    stellar_luminosity: float,      # W  (e.g. 3.828e26 for Sun)
    orbital_distance: float,        # m
    albedo: float,                  # bond albedo (0=black body, 0.3=Earth)
) -> float:
    """
    T_eq = ((L(1-A)) / (16πσd²))^0.25  →  equilibrium temperature
    + greenhouse forcing from CO2/CH4/H2O composition
    + internal heat contribution from radiogenic heating
    Returns: actual surface temperature [K]
    """
```

This closes the loop: composition → greenhouse → surface temp → habitability assessment.

---

## Priority 3 — Orbital Mechanics (the big missing piece)

The integrator handles simple trajectories well. But a planetary scientist doing mission design needs far more.

### 3a. Full Keplerian Analysis

The current `state_to_orbital_elements()` is correct but we're missing the analysis layer built on top of it.

```python
class OrbitalAnalysis:
    
    def nodal_precession_rate(self, planet, semi_major_axis, inclination) -> float:
        """
        dΩ/dt due to J2 oblateness.

    def apsidal_precession_rate(self, planet, semi_major_axis, eccentricity, inclination) -> float:
        """dω/dt due to J2."""

        """

        """
    
    def sun_synchronous_inclination(self, planet, semi_major_axis,

        """

        the planet's orbital motion around its star.

        """
    
    def repeat_ground_track(self, planet, semi_major_axis,
                            inclination, n_orbits: int, n_days: int) -> bool:
        """Does this orbit produce a repeat ground track in n_orbits / n_days?"""
    
    def lifetime_estimate(self, planet, semi_major_axis) -> float:
        """

```

### 3b. Ground Track and Coverage

        self,

    def time_to_full_coverage(

    ) -> float:
        """Days until every point on the surface has been observed at least once."""
    
    def revisit_time(

        Critical for monitoring active geology (volcanoes, dust storms, etc.)
        """
```

### 3c. Interplanetary Transfer

The current model is purely planet-centric. Real mission design starts with getting *to* the planet.
"hello"

## What This Becomes

If all of the above were implemented, Planet-RL would stop being an RL sandbox and become something more like **a first-principles planetary science workbench** — sitting between quick-calculation tools like GMAT's simplified interfaces and full-scale tools like SPICE or OpenOrb.

The niche it would occupy: **hypothesis testing for exoplanet science and mission concept studies**, where you want physical rigour but not the multi-month learning curve of aerospace-grade simulation suites.

Concrete scientific workflows it would enable:

1. *"Given this newly discovered exoplanet's mass and radius, what interior structure is consistent? What is the likely surface temperature? Is it in the HZ?"*

2. *"If we send a 500 kg spacecraft on a minimum-energy trajectory, can it insert into a 300 km orbit and survive the aerobraking campaign?"*

3. *"How does J2 precession rate change across a population of 500 procedurally generated planets? Does the scatter match what we'd predict from the rotation rate distribution?"*

4. *"Design a sun-synchronous repeat ground-track orbit for a hypothetical Mars-like exoplanet with 1.5× Earth's radius."*

5. *"Run a Monte Carlo over atmospheric density uncertainty: what is the 95th percentile heat load during aerobraking insertion?"*

## Implementation Priority Order

If implementing from scratch, the order that builds maximum scientific value per unit of effort:

| Phase | What to build | Why now |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | Multi-layer atmosphere + composition-derived properties | Fixes the biggest physical gap; everything else depends on atmosphere being realistic |
| **2** | StarSystem + HabitabilityAssessment | Immediately enables the most common science question ("is it habitable?") |
| **3** | Ground track + coverage map | Turns orbit calculations into actual science return |
| **4** | OrbitalAnalysis (frozen orbit, sun-sync, J2 drift) | Essential for mission design; builds on existing J2 code |
| **5** | Planet serialisation (JSON/YAML + fingerprinting) | Enables reproducibility; should exist before serious science use |
| **6** | InteriorConfig (layered structure, MoI) | Closes the loop on derived magnetic field and J2 |
| **7** | MissionProfile + AerobrakingCampaign | Enables end-to-end mission concept studies |
| **8** | Lambert solver + porkchop plot | Interplanetary transfers; most complex to implement correctly |
| **9** | N-body integrator | Proper moon dynamics, tidal evolution |
| **10** | PopulationAnalysis + SensitivityAnalysis | Statistical science on top of everything else |
